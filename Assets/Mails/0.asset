  title: Welcome!
  author: Boss
  body: welcome new employee. You will feel at home here at Stuff Industry. Me and
    my colleagues will send you emails for assignments, you will be expected to work
    24/7. You have software at your disposal, I don't know how to use it but you'll
    see for yourself, we won't do everything for you either. Well I will send you
    an email in a short time I write it at the same time as this one so be patient.
    Oh, and, I don't like people doing their work badly so I hope for you that you
    won't make any mistake.
